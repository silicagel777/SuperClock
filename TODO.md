# TODO list!

- Hardawre issues on low brightness:
  - Ghosting on prevous leds (FET drain capacitance?)
  - Why non-uniform brigthness fix removed ghosting?!
  - Yellow/red leds on the same column make green leds dimmer on low brightness
- Reorganize font system
- Free-running ADC
- Adc filtering
- More levels for highest and lowest brightness?
- Use c++ namespaces?
- Abstractions for pins and timers?
- Snake mode? :D
- Animated minute/hour transitions
