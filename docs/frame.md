You can further enhance the looks of your clock by laser-cutting an acrylic housing. You can find the DWG, DXF and PDF files here:

The front panel comes in two flavors: short and long. The short one only covers the front, while the long one is designed with an upper fin can be bent to cover the top. Most houses charge premium for acrylic bending, so I recommend ordering the usual laser cutting and then bending it yourself. Here are some tips:

- Place the acrylic on the metallic surface with 90-degree side (some big metal box) and fix it in place with something heavy. The part you want to bend should be protruding on the side.
- Carefully heat the bend line with sweeping motions of a hot-air gun. I've set mine to 300Â°C
- One the bend line softens, carefully bend the sheet

If you are ordering PCBs from [Elecrow](https://www.elecrow.com/), you can also use their acrylic cutting service and have everything in one order. I've used the 3mm transparent (000) acrylic.
